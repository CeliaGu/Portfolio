        <h3>Virtual Reality Headset Design</h3>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>
          This is the final project of the material design course which
          is asked us to explore the possibilities of conceiving and
          constructing a Virtual Reality (VR) headset without electronic
          components. The materials that our group is assigned are metal
          and plastic which are easy to manufacture and not cost-prohibitive.</p>
          <h4>Skills</h4>
          <p>
            Researching and using different materials open up my abilities as
            a researcher and model maker. Before the course, I worked with
            mostly wood-based materials like paper as well as thin plastic
            and acrylic sheets. Now I think I can make higher fidelity prototypes/models.
            Additionally, having access to solid space in the school with all
            the tools and machinery allow me to be more creative and ambitious
            since I don’t need to worry about how to make the special shape or
            the cost of the machine.</p>
            <h4>Challenges & Changes</h4>
            <p>We face the precision issue when we transfer the initial sketch
              to the actual model. Because the plastic is laser-cut and we need
              to bend the plastic manually, the dimensions are hard to predict
              and calculate. The pieces end up not fitting very well, so we bend
              the plastic edges more and add TPE plastic to fill the gap.<br>
              Another challenge is to find out which glue is the most effective
              in bonding metal and plastic together. This is achieved by researching
              and testing different products to find the one that matched our needs.
            </p>
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>Our VR headset is designed for the interior designer for
              their clients to have a better understanding of the design.
              The VR headset is mainly composed of laser-cut acrylic plastic
              and hand-cut stainless steel. There is a magnet between the
              front surface and the body so the user can easily open the
              front cover to insert their phone.<br>
              Since my group members and I have worked together previously,
              we know who is more confident in doing a particular phase.
              Therefore we collaborate with each other well. We learn how
              to design a product from designing, material choosing, prototyping,
              final model making, and finishing. We will work on decorating the
              headset if we have more time.

            <h3>Ecological Footprint Website Design</h3>
            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
              This is a school project working with the city of Vancouver to
              present current Vancouver’s ecological footprint by designing
              an online information website and an offline product. The goal
              of this project is to let citizens realize our city’s environmental
              situation, and what can they do to protect our planet.</p>
              <h4>Skills</h4>
              <p>
                Through the process of doing this project, my skills in searching
                and summarizing information improved a lot. Now I can read and
                understand a new article in a quick time and summarize the key
                point. I learned how to design visual representations of
                information, such as using images. Explored the relationship
                between code and information architecture during I made the
                website page. I had a better understanding of the information’s
                hierarchy as well.</p>
                <h4>Challenges & Changes</h4>
                <p>The challenge of this project is how to transfer the academic
                  report provided by the city of Vancouver to brief sentences
                  that everyone can understand. I read and understand the report,
                  and search online first to summarize the information.<br>
                  Another challenge is how to encourage people to get to
                  the website to know the information about ecological
                  footprint. So we designed a cup sleeve for people who use
                  single-use cups and sleeves. The sleeve has our website’s
                  link and code for winning a free prize to motivate people
                  to look at the website.
                </p>
                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                <p>Overall, our offline design and online design work well
                  because they have a strong connection with each other. The
                  sentence wrote on the sleeve encourage people to use a
                  reusable bottle and reduce the waste and protect the
                  environment. The content on the website is easy to read and
                  understand.<br>
                  My team members and I worked well on collaborating and
                  communicating. It was our first time to made a complete
                  website, from designing layout and information to coding
                  the website. If we have more time, we will work on HTML
                  and CSS to make the website more organized and more readable
                  on different size of screens.
